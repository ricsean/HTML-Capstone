<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Ricsean Earl C. Del Mundo. I am a fresh graduate from Laguna College with a degree on Computer Science. Throughout my 
  college years, I have consistently demonstrated a strong commitment to software and application development. I have developed a 
  variety of applications using different programming languages such as Visual Basic, Java, Python, and so on that have been recognized 
  as some of the best in my class. I am a fast learner. I love learning about new ideas as well as figuring out a new one. I like to try
  new ways in order to learn or gain new knowledge about things that I am interested in. I constantly aim to improve myself, my 
  knowledge and my skills, and I'm always seeking better actions and solutions to anything that I am working on. I am eager on 
  constantly evolving to be able to contribute to this industry that I am passionate about.</p>

<p>My greatest strength is my ability to identify irregularities or issues. During my college days, my classmates often approached me 
  to analyze their programming output whenever they encountered problems. In most cases, I was able to pinpoint the problem and offer 
  advice on how to resolve it.</p>

<p>My biggest weakness is public speaking. I tend to get nervous when addressing an audience. However, I am actively working on 
  overcoming this challenge because I recognize that I can't remain this way and that improvement is necessary. Currently, Iâ€™m trying 
  to improving my vocabulary because most of the time, I forget about the words that I want to say which is the reason why I mostly 
  mess up.</p>

  <p>My hobbies are playing badminton, riding my bike going to far places, watching movies and animes, playing computer games, playing
  the guitar while singing, and many more.</p>
